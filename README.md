# hello-world
This is me venturing into a new frontier I've always wanted to learn.

I have no idea what I'm going to do or create, but I really want to learn coding - I feel like it's the most elusive piece of knowledge that I just have to learn. So I'm starting slowly, but surely. Coding workshops and boot camps just dont work for me, so I'm going to try and build a project on my own. I seem to learn best when I'm presented with a problem and I can go down a rabbit hole of learning.
